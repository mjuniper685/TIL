# How to use EmdDash EnDash on Windows 10

I needed to use this in a SharePoint title I was copying of someone elses. It came out in the internal name as _x2013_. This was something I'd never seen before so I just added it in as a regular dash.

However once I looked it up I needed to work out how to do it. 

On Mac its quite easy, it's just Option + Hyphen key.

On Windows 10 however I had to open the Emoji tray by pressing Windows + Period then find the EnDash via there.

Once I added it in it worked fine! Just a bit of a long winded way. No idea why the person decided to use this format either!
