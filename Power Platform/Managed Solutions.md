# Managed Solutions

Managed Solutions are for deploying your platform components to a TEST or PROD environment. Any component inside a managed package cannot be changed*

You create a Managed Solution from an Unmanaged Solution. When in the Solutions menu, clicking "Export" provides you with the option to export as Managed/Unmanaged. 

*In theory, in practice I have found you can edit Power Apps and Flows. In fact you often need to do this as connections do not get added in new environments.
