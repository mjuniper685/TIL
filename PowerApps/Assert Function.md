# Assert Function
The assert function is used in the experimental PowerApps test studio to assert the expected result of your tests.

Assert takes the form:

```
Assert(expression, message)
```
Where the expression is the condition you want to prove and the message is what is displayed if the condition is false.

Using Assert you can build quite complicated statments to confirm the outcome of your tests.
