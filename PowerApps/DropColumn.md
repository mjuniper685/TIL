# DropColumns()

This formula is useful for reducing tables down to use in formulas which only accept one column tables. As well as dropping additional columns from tables you don't need.

The DropColumns() doesn't modify the original table, it just returns a new modified table. It looks like the following:

```
DropColumns(IceCreamSales, "UnitPrice")
```
